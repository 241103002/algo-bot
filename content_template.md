📘 Topic: String Algorithms

🧠 Overview  
String algorithms deal with the manipulation and analysis of strings (sequences of characters). These algorithms are essential for various applications such as text searching, pattern matching, and data compression. Some common string algorithms include pattern matching algorithms, tries, and prefix trees.

\#\#\# 🔍 Pattern Matching Algorithms  
Pattern matching involves finding occurrences of a smaller string (pattern) within a larger string (text).

\- \*\*Naive Algorithm\*\*: This is the simplest approach where we try to match the pattern at every position in the text.  
\- \*\*KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)\*\*: Uses a preprocessing phase to reduce unnecessary comparisons by leveraging previous matches.  
\- \*\*Rabin-Karp\*\*: Uses hashing to improve search efficiency.

\#\#\# 🔠 Tries (Prefix Trees)  
A \*\*Trie\*\* is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. It is used for tasks like \*\*auto-completion\*\* and \*\*dictionary implementations\*\*.

\- \*\*Insert\*\*: Inserting a string in a trie involves creating new nodes for every character in the string if they don't already exist.  
\- \*\*Search\*\*: Searching for a string involves traversing the trie by following the characters of the string.

\#\#\# 💡 Prefix Trees  
Prefix trees are a type of trie that stores strings that share common prefixes, optimizing memory usage. They are often used for \*\*autocomplete\*\* suggestions and \*\*spell checking\*\*.

\#\#\# 🧩 Key Takeaways  
\- String matching algorithms like \*\*KMP\*\* and \*\*Rabin-Karp\*\* are crucial for efficient text searching.  
\- \*\*Tries\*\* are an efficient way to store and retrieve strings, especially when there are many shared prefixes.  
\- \*\*Prefix trees\*\* optimize tries by reducing redundancy.
